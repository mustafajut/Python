# **Implementation of Classes and Objects**
**Definition:**
Classes and objects are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. A class defines a blueprint for objects, and objects are instances of classes.

**Importance:**
Promotes code reusability.
Encapsulates data and functions together.

# **OOP Principles in Python**
**Definition:**
Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is based on four main principles: *Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.*

**Importance:**
* Encapsulation: Bundles data with methods that operate on the data.
*Inheritance: Enables new classes to inherit attributes and methods from existing classes.
* Polymorphism: Allows methods to be used interchangeably between different classes.
* Abstraction: Hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features.
